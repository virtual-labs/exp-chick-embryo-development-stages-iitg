#### EVENTS IN EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT IN CHICKS

The process of embryonic development in chickens starts with fertilization, where an egg is fertilized by sperm, leading to the growth and division of cells in the egg. As these cells continue to divide, they take on specific functions and form different tissues in the embryo.


After the egg is laid, there is a period of no growth during which the embryo remains in a dormant state. However, once incubation begins, the embryo rapidly starts to develop. The incubation period for a chicken egg is approximately 20-21 days, requiring a temperature of around 37-38 celsius.


As the incubation process continues, the embryo develops and forms the different parts of the chick, ultimately leading to the hatching of a healthy and fully-formed chick.


#### EVENTS IN EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT

* <b> Day 1: </b>We start to see the basic shape of a chick embryo, the formation of the digestive system, the development of the backbone, the start of the nervous system, the beginning of the head, and the formation of the eyes.<br>

* <b> Day 2: </b>On the second day of embryonic development, the heart begins to form and the ears start to develop.Furthermore, the heart begins to beat and the pronephric tubules emerge.<br>

* <b> Day 3: </b>On the day third of embryonic development, several organs and structures begin to form. The nose, legs, and wings are visible, while the liver and pancreatic primordia are evident. Additionally, the hind intestine gives rise to the allantoic diverticulum.The vitelline membrane spreads over the yolk's surface.<br>

* <b> Day 4: </b>On the day four of embryonic development, the embryo begins to form its digestive organs, including the tongue, esophagus, stomach (both glandular and muscular portions), midgut, and hindgut primordia. Additionally, the amniotic cavity, which will later protect and allow for movement of the embryo, is established. The brain further divides into four distinct parts.<br>

* <b> Day 5: </b>On the day five of embryonic development, the embryo's head and tail regions come together to form a distinctive C shape. The fingers on the inferior limbs become distinct, and the reproductive organs begin to differentiate, thereby determining the sex of the chick.<br>

* <b> Day 6: </b>On the day six of embryonic development, the beak begins to form, the eyes become more pronounced, the heart and brain become visible, and the embryo exhibits the ability to move voluntarily.<br>

* <b> Day 7: </b>The development of the embryo proceeds with the thinning of the neck, clearly distinguishing the head from the body. Additionally, the beak begins to enlarge.<br>

* <b> Day 8: </b>The eighth day of embryonic development, the feather buds begin to appear. The external opening of the ear has formed.<br>

* <b> Day 9: </b>Vascularization increases and the very first feather follicles start appearing.<br>

* <b> Day 10: </b>On the tenth day, the beak starts to harden and the egg tooth appears.<br>

* <b> Day 11: </b>Feathers have begun to appear and eyelids grow larger.<br>

* <b> Day 12: </b>The toes get formed fully.<br>

* <b> Day 13: </b>Scales and claws start to appear<br>

* <b> Day 14: </b>The embryo gets into the position it needs to be in to hatch.i.e., turns its head towards the blunt end.This posture is essential for the hatching process as it allows for the chick to push its head against the blunt end of the eggshell.<br>

* <b> Day 15: </b>The embryo, during the hatching process, takes up a specific position known as the pipping position.This position involves the embryo positioning its head underneath its right wing. This positioning of the embryo is believed to assist in the hatching process by providing an area of weakness in the eggshell, which the embryo can break through to emerge.<br>

* <b> Day 16: </b>The scales, claws, and beak become farm and strong and feather covers the whole body.<br>

* <b> Day 17: </b>On the seventeenth day, the beak turns towards the air cell inside the egg and the embryo's renal system produces urates.<br>

* <b> Day 18: </b>Embryo ÓÅálls the available space and the yolk sac is largely absorbed.<br>

* <b> Day 19 : </b>On the nineteenth day, the yolk sac, which nourishes the embryo, begins to move into the body cavity.<br>

* <b> Day 20: </b>On the twentieth day, the yolk sac is fully inside the body cavity, and the embryo takes up most of the space inside the egg and chick begins pipping through shell<br>

* <b> Day 21: </b>Finally, on the twenty-first day, the chick hatches, marking the end of the embryonic development.<br>

<br><i>It's a complex process that involves multiple stages, but it's amazing how the egg develops into a fully formed chick with all the necessary systems.</i>
